# BerryBot
First open souce and public Zombix Online bot
This bot is still in very early beta, so expect loads of errors.
Prequsites:
mouse 
time
os 
keyboard
ahk (the python wrapper)

Install all of these with pip3
This is written for a certain monitor size, so you need to adjust the coordinates.
The inside is heavily documented, so you can see where to put the coords so it works for your computer.
The bot users the joystick to move, so movements arent perfect.
Im working daily to improve the features.
The only 2 scripts on the bot are berryfarmer and zombieslayer.
Berryfarmer collects berries. Start in any bush.
Zombieslayer fights zombies but does not pick up loot...Yet.

Remember to adjust your settings.
In update v1.1 im adding calibration settings so anyone can easily setup the client without edting the code.
I will also be adding custom script uploading and maybe like an sdn system.
Much more scripts being added and auto healing, looting and crafting soon!
